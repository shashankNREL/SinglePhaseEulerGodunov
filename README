FluidSolverFrameworkGeneral: Solves the compressible Euler equations using
the upwind scheme in AMReX. The algorithm used is from Kwatra and Fedkiw (2011).
Test cases of Sod shock tube, Gaussian acoustic pulse are done. The inputs needed
these are in SingleVortex/TestInputs. The necessary routines are in Source/Testing. 
To run the acoustic pulse case, copy SingleVortex/TestInputs to SingleVortex/inputs
and Source/Testing/test_acousticpulse3D to Source directory. Then do sh run_3d.sh
in SingleVortex. A jet in crossflow test case is also done.

It is a AMReX based code designed to run in parallel using MPI/OMP.
It uses the Fortran interfaces of AMReX.

The directory Exec/SingleVortex includes a makefile and a sample inputs file.  
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d.
