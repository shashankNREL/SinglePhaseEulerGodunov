Solves the compressible Euler equations using
the upwind scheme in AMReX. The algorithm used is from Kwatra and Fedkiw (2011).
Test cases of Sod shock tube, Gaussian acoustic pulse are done. A supersonic jet
in subsonic crossflow test is also done.
1. To run shock tube do
sh run_SodShockTube.sh
sh run_3d.sh
2. To run acoustic pulse 3d
sh run_AcousticPulse3d.sh
sh run_3d.sh
3. To run jet in crossflow
sh run_JICF.sh
sh run_3d.sh
It is a AMReX based code designed to run in parallel using MPI/OMP.
It uses the Fortran interfaces of AMReX. Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed 
with amrvis2d / amrvis3d. (CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable 
separately from ccse.lbl.gov) or with Visit.
